         Hello Everyone!
         Welcome to my website, my name is Arushi Singh and it is a pleasure to have you here! I created this platform to showcase my diverse talents, including the cool programs I’ve developed, professional ideas, art, dance, and much more.
         I’m originally from New Jersey, USA, but when I was 8 years old, I moved to India, where I completed 10 years of schooling. I’ve always had a passion for creativity—whether it’s building something new, coming up with innovative ideas, or exploring different forms of art. This website is a reflection of my love for creating and sharing my journey.
         I’m also an avid traveler. In 2024, I took a solo trip to Hawaii, where I earned my scuba diving certification. On the right, you can see a picture of me with my scuba buddy, Chuan!
         This website was designed using HTML and CSS, hosted on an EC2 instance in AWS, and deployed via GitHub. I’m proud to share this project with you and hope you enjoy exploring it!		 </div>

       I am currently a Business Intelligence Engineer at Abercrombie & Fitch Co. In this role, I work extensively with business intelligence tools such as Power BI, Tableau, and OBIEE, as well as data warehouses like Snowflake and Netezza. I’ve been honing my expertise in these technologies for the past 2.5 years.
       In college, I had the privilege of being the captain of my Bollywood dance team, "Jhanak." One of our most memorable performances was at Knoxville Ki Jawaani, where we secured 3rd place. Our theme creatively combined the movie Inside Out with a commentary on mental health in brown culture. The performance featured diverse dance styles, including Hip-Hop, Contemporary, Bhangra, and more.
       As captain, I took on multiple roles: choreographing the dances, teaching the team, conceptualizing the performance, writing the script, designing costumes and props, fundraising, and even doing makeup for every performer you see in the video.
       Beyond my work in tech and dance, I am also a professional makeup artist. I enjoy collaborating with models and bringing creative visions to life through makeup artistry on the side.		 </div>

     <h2>Subject Area: Computer Science</h2>
     <h3>Title: Academic Portal</h3>
     <h3>Date Created: March 2017</h3>
     <p>Description: I created this application as part of my IBDP Internal Assessment for Computer Science. Back in my school in India, we didn’t have a modern grading system like Canvas—everything was recorded in physical notebooks that professors carried everywhere.

To address this, I designed and developed a digital grading portal. The application’s interface was built using JavaScript, and it utilizes HSQLDB as its database.

In this portal:

Teachers can enter and edit grades, which are securely stored in the database.
Students can log in to view their grades but have read-only access.
This system was designed to streamline the grading process and make it more efficient for both teachers and students. Check out the demo on the right to see it in action!<p>

     <h2>Subject Area: Mathematics</h2>
     <h3>Title: Orbit of The Moon</h3>
     <h3>Date Created: May 2017</h3>
     <p>Description:This project is one of my all-time favorites. As part of my Math HL Internal Assessment in the IBDP, we had to either research a concept or create something new. Being a huge space enthusiast, I chose to research the orbit of the moon.

As a child, I was obsessed with the idea of becoming an astronaut, and this project allowed me to explore that passion. I focused on the apogee and perigee of the moon, which, in simple terms, can be thought of as the radius of a circle. Using these concepts, I aimed to derive a formula to calculate the circumference of the moon's orbit.

However, there’s a twist—the moon’s orbit doesn’t remain stationary. The universe is constantly in motion (as suggested by the Big Bang Theory), and the moon’s orbit shifts over time due to a phenomenon called apsidal precession—the gradual rotation of the orbit itself. My formula accounts for this dynamic movement, making it a unique approach to understanding the moon’s path through space.

You can find a detailed explanation of this concept in the project.

       <h2>Subject Area: The Arts</h2>
       <h3>Title: Reality vs Representations</h3>
       <h3>Date Created: May 2018</h3>
       <p>Description:  am also a professional artist! During my time in the IBDP, I took Art HL and created a wide range of artworks that I’m excited to share with you. While I have an extensive collection, it’s impossible to showcase everything here.

I work with a variety of mediums, including oil, watercolor, acrylic, sculpture, knitting, and almost anything else I can get my hands on. On the right, you can see a glimpse into my creative process, which includes how I generate ideas and bring them to life. You’ll also notice how my work is influenced by other artists and how I reinterpret their techniques and themes into something uniquely my own.<p>  		 </div>

    <h2>Subject Area: Analytics</h2>
    <h3>Title: Netflix Wrapped</h3>
    <h3>Date Created: April 2024</h3>
    <p>Description:This is a fun project I worked on after having an idea. I’m a huge fan of cinema—if I could get lost in the world of movies, I absolutely would! Sometimes, I struggle to pick a new show or movie to watch. I realized that understanding my viewing habits could make it much easier to choose.

To explore this, I downloaded all my Netflix data, cleaned and organized it by variables like date, genre, and more. Then, I loaded the data into Power BI and created my very own dashboard, which I’ve named Netflix Wrapped (inspired by Spotify Wrapped!).

A few fun insights:

My most-watched genre is Comedy, and my most-viewed show is The Office.
This discovery has made me more confident about choosing comedies because I enjoy lighthearted content and a good laugh.
There’s so much more I can do with this dashboard, and it has sparked my desire to delve deeper into Data Science to uncover even more insights in the future.<p>    </div>

       <h2>Subject Area: Analytics/Psychology</h2>
       <h3>Title: Mood</h3>
       <h3>Date Created: August 2021</h3>
       <p>Description:
Memory updated
Your project is deeply meaningful and innovative. Here’s a polished version of your description:

Revised Text:
This project is the one I am most proud of because of its personal significance. It was born during a tough period in my life when the future felt uncertain. Being a problem solver, I wanted to create something that could help me understand and navigate my emotions better.

I started by tracking my mood daily on a scale from -5 (worst) to 5 (best). I also considered various metrics that could influence mood swings. Each day, I logged my mood into an Excel sheet, creating a cumulative score over time. I then connected this data to Tableau, where I built a visualization to track mood trends. The chart showed how my mood fluctuated and often correlated with events in my life.

While this is still in the testing phase and needs extensive research, I’ve collaborated with Psychology students from Columbia University to validate my approach. I believe this tool has immense potential in therapy—therapists could ask patients to log their moods daily, identify patterns, and even use analytics to detect signs of depression or other mental health challenges.

For me, personally, it was incredibly rewarding to see my chart improve after a period of lows. It provided a sense of progress when progress wasn’t always easy to feel.

Ultimately, my goal is to refine this idea further and help as many people as possible. Whatever I create, I want to ensure it brings joy and positivity to people’s lives.<p>  		 </div>
